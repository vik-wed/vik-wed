## Hi, I'm Vik!

I switched from administrative work (comms, sales, operations) to software engineering because I wanted to **build things** (and I haven’t looked back.)

Today, I’m a **Solutions Engineer at [Axios HQ](https://www.axioshq.com/)**, where I support 1,000+ customers and fix bugs and build full stack features with **React, Next.js, Django, and Python**.  
My background outside of tech helps me understand real user needs — and now I get to turn those into technical solutions that actually make people’s jobs easier.

Before Axios, I worked as a **Full Stack Engineer** building event dashboards, static sites, and SaaS tools for creatives and startups using **TypeScript, Next.js, Postgres, Prisma**, and **Firebase**.  
I’ve also contributed to CI/CD pipelines, internal tools, and UI systems that improved efficiency and developer experience.

### A few things about me
- I thrive in teams that value **ownership and trust** over micromanagement.  
- I love debugging weird issues (and the excitement that comes with **finding the solution**).  
- I think programming is a lot like **building IKEA furniture**, just with better naming conventions.

### Tools & Tech
**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, SQL  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, RESTful APIs, Postgres/PostgreSQL, Firebase, Prisma, Django  
**Other:** Git, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, AWS, Vercel, Netlify, ESLint, Agile/Scrum

### Currently learning
- Improving my backend skills by diving deeper into Python
